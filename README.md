## Blue Team Enthusiast | Junior SOC Analyst (Aspiring)

Junior cybersecurity enthusiast focused on SOC operations, incident analysis, and defensive security.

I have hands-on experience gained through CTF competitions, PentesterLab labs, and practical cybersecurity training, covering network analysis, web reconnaissance, and system security. I enjoy analyzing suspicious activity, understanding attack techniques, and clearly documenting findings.

Currently studying Computer Science while actively preparing for entry-level SOC Analyst roles, with a strong interest in Blue Team operations, security monitoring, and incident response.
